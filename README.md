## Drinks presets
With this mod you can finally create up to 3 presets for your drinks, got a farming drink setup? You can save it. Got a NG push setup? You can save it!
Afterwards you can load it up.

## Usage
Talk to the drink trader as usual, buy the drinks you want to use after you're done, click on save preset.

### How do I enable mods?
1. Click the "Profiles" button in the main menu. (It's the button left of the Singleplayer button)

2. Click "Clone this profile" so that you have a secondary profile to use for modding. (Note: Enabling mods on a profile disables achievements for that profile!)

3. Click the "Change mods" button (the button with the cog) for the secondary profile. (You might be asked whether you're sure you want to continue adding mods, click Yes.)

4. Select the mods you want to use and click OK. Mods are now enabled on that profile!

Have fun!
